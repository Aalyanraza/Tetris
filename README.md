## Introduction

In this project, I have developed a Tetris game using C++ and the SFML library. The game follows the classic Tetris mechanics, where players manipulate falling blocks to create complete rows. The objective is to score as many points as possible by clearing lines and preventing the blocks from stacking up to the top.

## Features

- Add a list of features implemented in your Tetris game.
- For example:
  - Block manipulation: Rotate, move, and place blocks.
  - Scoring system: Track and display the player's score based on cleared lines.
  - File handling: Save and load game progress and high scores.
  - Customize gameplay settings: Speed, difficulty, etc.
