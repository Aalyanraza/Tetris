## Introduction

In this project, I have developed a Tetris game using C++ and the SFML library. The game follows the classic Tetris mechanics, where players manipulate falling blocks to create complete rows. The objective is to score as many points as possible by clearing lines and preventing the blocks from stacking up to the top.

## Features

  - Block manipulation: Rotate, move, and place blocks.
  - Scoring system: Track and display the player's score based on cleared lines.
  - File handling: Save and load game progress and high scores.
  - Menu was displayed on terminal 

## Installation

To run the game, you will need sfml library downloaded. For that click the under given link:
https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php

## Usage

Run the following commands on ubunto terminal after installing the required libraries and hopefully your game will run
<br />g++ -c main.cpp
<br />g++ main.o -o sfml-app -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
<br />./sfml-app
